Title: Characterization of Alternative Splicing based on Paired-End Reads
Author: Manuel Kroiss, Camille Stephan-Otto, Almond Strocker, David Rossell
Maintainer: David Rossell <david.rossell@irbbarcelona.org>
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), Biobase, IRanges, methods, gtools, GenomicFeatures, GenomicRanges
Suggests: multicore
Description: The package provides methodology to infer alternative splicing patterns for paired-end based on high-throughput sequencing data. Both quantification of known splicing variants and de novo splice variant discovery are considered. The approach is based on a flexible Bayesian model which estimates the RNA fragment size distribution, allows the user to set part of the data to missing values to remove artifacts, and is computationally efficient.
